# ☀️ Dual Axis Solar Tracking System
## 📖 Overview
A Dual Axis Solar Tracking System is an advanced mechanism designed to optimize the orientation of solar panels by continuously adjusting both horizontal (azimuth) and vertical (elevation) angles. This ensures maximum sunlight exposure throughout the day, significantly increasing energy output compared to fixed systems.

## ⚙️ Features
### 📈 Increased Energy Production – Up to 40% more efficient than fixed panels.

### 🌥 Better Performance in Low Light – Tracks optimal light direction.

### 💰 Maximized ROI – Faster return on investment via better energy capture.

### 📐 Space Optimization – Effective use of installation area.

## 🧱 Components Used
### 🔋 Solar Panels – Convert sunlight into electricity.

### 🧠 Microcontroller (Arduino) – Brain of the system, controls movement.

### 🌞 Light Sensors (LDRs) – Detect sunlight intensity and direction.

### ⚙️ Motors (Servo) – Move the solar panel along both axes.

### 🏗 Mounting Structure – Holds the system and allows movement.

### 🔌 Power Supply –  USB for powering electronics.

### 💻 Software – Code to manage logic and motor control.

## 🛠️ Construction Steps
Design the Frame – Allows movement along horizontal and vertical axes.

### Install Motors – Control panel tilt and rotation.

### Place Sensors – Strategically around the panel for optimal tracking.

### Program Microcontroller – Handle sensor data and control motors.

### Assemble & Test – Final integration and functional validation.

## 🌱 Benefits
### ✔️ Optimized solar energy absorption

### ✔️ Long-term cost savings

### ✔️ Eco-friendly power solution

### ✔️ Scalable for larger installations

## 📊 Conclusion
Dual Axis Solar Tracking Systems represent a leap forward in solar technology. Although initial setup costs may be higher, the significant gain in efficiency and sustainability makes this system ideal for a wide range of real-world applications.
